This project was developed over the span of 9 weeks by 5 students for the "Advanced C++" course at De Anza College.

As 1 of the 2 leaders, my responsibilities were team coordinations, code integration, developing the monster class and algorithms, and assisting with the development of the player class and main game code.

### Game Play

In this mini survival game, you play as a cat collecting coins. Meanwhile, monsters spawn at random; it is your goal to collect as many coins as possible to increase your score while surviving your encounters with these monsters.

Starting with 5 lives, any collision with these monsters counts as 1 deduction. You can fight by pressing "A", enabling you to defeat these monsters, or you could press "S" to temporarily brace yourself for 1 incoming attack.

### My Reflection and Thoughts

### Note

This project requires linking of SFML library and that all assets are in the same directory as the code files.
Theme music size (https://youtu.be/gsr19Kdf3Lk) was too large for GitHub, so not included.
