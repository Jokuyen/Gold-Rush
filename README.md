In the span of 2 months, this project was developed by 5 students for the "Advanced C++" course at De Anza College.

As one of the two leaders, my responsibilities included team coordinations, code integration, animation, developing the monster class and algorithms, and assisting with the development of the player class and main game code.

### Game Play

In this mini survival game, you play as a cat collecting coins. Meanwhile, monsters spawn at random; it is your goal to collect as many coins as possible to increase your score while surviving your encounters with these wandering monsters.

Beginning with 5 lives, any collision with these monsters counts as 1 deduction. You can attack by pressing "A", enabling you to defeat these monsters, or you could press "S" to temporarily brace yourself for 1 incoming attack. 

Monsters will gradually increase in speed and number as you collect more coins. At every 50 coins collected, a key spawns that enables you to open the door to a boss. Defeating this boss with your attacks will grant 3 lives.

If you ever find a cluser of monsters, you can drop a bomb in the selected area with a mouse click!

### My Reflection and Thoughts

Even though this is a simple game, the development process was difficultâ€”especially considering that this was everyone's first time creating a game. I picked up animation as a responsibility since no one on my team had artistic talent; figuring out this process was a valuable lesson for me.

### Note

This project requires linking of SFML library and that all assets are in the same directory as the code files.
Theme music size (https://youtu.be/gsr19Kdf3Lk) was too large for GitHub, so know that it could not be included.
